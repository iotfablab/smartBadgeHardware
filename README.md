# smartBadgeHardware
This repository holds the hardware design files for the iotfablab Smart Badge.

The hardware layout has been adapted from the "Sparkfun ESP-32-Thing Plus" (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14689) and the "Waveshare e-Paper ESP32 Driver Board" (https://www.waveshare.com/e-paper-esp32-driver-board.htm).

It is designed to work with 
* the Waveshare 2.9 inch raw e-Paper Display (https://www.waveshare.com/2.9inch-e-Paper.htm) and 
* a 1 cell 3.7V LiPo battery with 2mm JST plug (e.g. https://www.exp-tech.de/zubehoer/batterien-akkus/lipo-akkus/9365/lipo-akku-750mah-3.7-v-2-mm-jst?c=1191).
